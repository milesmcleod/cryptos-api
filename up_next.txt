need these values in each coin for jay:

return an object instead of an array to the /coins get, where the key value pairs are [rank/id]: { coinObject }

create a get history API endpoint where all coin histories are sent up as an object where the key value pairs are [symbol]: { historyObject }

fix ETH market queries so that getCoinData works for both BTC- and ETH-based currencies

bid value in USD
market cap ( volume * bid value in USD )
24 hour percent change ( bid - prevDay) / prevDay
